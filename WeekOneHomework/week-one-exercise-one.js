// create a variable that holds a String. Add a string to your variable. Log the answer in your console. Load it into the browser and check your answer.
var a = "One string ";
var b = "plus another string";

let c = a +''+b;
// this returns "One string plus another string"


// create a variable that holds an integer (is this suppose to be 1 or 2 numbers???)
var num1 = 8;
var num2 = 7;

let num3 = 8 * 7;
console.log(8 * 7)

// the way this is written is sounds like you are suppose to make a variable that stores a string and then a variable that stores a number and multiply the two together. 

var words = "this is the string";
var int = 7;

let whoKnows = words * int;
console.log(words * int)

// this returns NaN because I don't think you can multiply a number by a string. Is this the result you were looking for???? This concludes exercise one of week one.
