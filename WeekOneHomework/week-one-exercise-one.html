<p>The instructions say to create an html file. Ok, done. Then internally create a variable that stores a string. Now I am suppose to add this "string" to a variable and log the answer in the console. Now I am suppose to load it in the browser and check the answer. I do not know for certain what this is suppose to mean.</p>
