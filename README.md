# cbc8homework_redo
I am trying to organize the homework assignments by weeks.


Week 1
Lab work
Exercise ClI
Make a directory on your Desktop folder and name it something like cbc-6.
Navigate in that folder and create another folder and name it something like first web project.
In that folder create a file called something like hey-there.txt
Open that file and add some text
Exercise Github
Instructional Demonstration
Create a new repository on Github.
CLI: navigate to the folder inside your cbc-6 folder.
CLI: git add .
CLI: git commit -m "[...]"
Write a message in the [...]
Copy from Github the line that says git remote add [...]
CLI: Paste what you copied and press enter
CLI: git push -u origin master
Refresh Github to see if it worked.
Group Activity
Create a directory on the Desktop
Create a file in your root folder and name it "readme.md"
Move reamde.md to your Desktop
Rename folder created on desktop (step 1) as "gitproject"
Create a repository on Github named "gitproject"
Push that folder on your Desktop to Github
Delete your local folder
Exercise Markdown
Add a readme.md file to your project
Use 6 of the above concepts to explain your text file.
Exercise datatypes
in the browser add 2 strings together and return the answer
create an html file
internally, create a variable that stores a string
add a string to your variable (+)
log the answer to the console
load it into the browser to check the answer
link to an external javascript file
create a variable that stores a string
create a variable that stores an integer
multiply those two variables together (*)
log the answer to the console
load the browser to check the answer
bonus in your external javascript file
add 2 + true and see what you get
Exercise conditional
note from now on we are going to assume you are working on an external javascript file

create a counter variable with the value of 2
add 5 to it
then multiply that result by 2
log the output. Did you get 14?
modulo that answer by 3. Before you log the answer write a comment what you think it is going to return.
What happens when you modulo that answer by 2? Write in a comment if it returned what you expected?
create an if statement that tests if your variable modulus 2 returns 0
log in the console the answer
Create an else statement that logs that the variable was not even
create a conditional statement that tests the state of your variable in 4 different ways
in each of them link 2 comparisons together using logical operators
create 3 if statements back to back. Comment the difference between multiple if statements and 1 conditional statement.
Exercise loop
create a counter variable
add 1 and log it 50 times using a for loop
make a while loop that logs every other number up until 50
loop from 0 to 100
log the string fizz if the number is divisible by 3
log the string buzz if the number is divisible by 5
log the string fizzbuzz if the number is divisibly by both
Exercise function
create a function that takes two arguments and adds them together
create a function that takes two arguments and multiplies them together
create a function that takes two arguments where the first argument is the start number and the second argument is the end number. The body of the function starts a loop and ends it at the second argument and logs every number between the start and end number.
create a variable in the global scope
create a function that takes an argument
add the argument to the global variable
log the return of that function
create an IIFE that logs your success of creating an IIFE
Exercise math
create a function that takes user input and compares it against a random number. If there is a match then log the success.
Exercise array
make an array of 10 grocery store items loop through that array and log each item.
loop through a string at least 10 characters long and log each character
make that string upper case
Exercise arrays 2: revenge of the index
Create an inventory array and associate a number with each item. Then get user input that purchases items (subtracts one from the item).
Exercise grocery store app
Grocery Store app
functions: - add to inventory - subtract from inventory - Notify when out of stock
data:
inventory
inventory count
